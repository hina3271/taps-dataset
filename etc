Recording Hardware configuration
To accurately measure neck vibrations, a device that adheres to the skin and records acceleration is required. Additionally, to construct a paired dataset with both throat microphone and acoustic microphone signals, simultaneous recording is essential. To meet these requirements, we developed a custom-built paired data collection system (Figure 1 b and c). This system consisted of a throat microphone, an acoustic microphone, and a microcontroller unit (MCU).
The throat microphone used a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer (TDK, IIM-42652) to capture vibration acceleration on the neck's surface. The accelerometer was configured with an 8 kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution, with a Â±4g dynamic range, ensuring the accurate capture of various signal magnitudes. The vibration signal was recorded as z-axis acceleration values, perpendicular to the neck skin. The throat microphone, with a 9 mm radius and 1.7 mm thickness, was fabricated on an FR-4 printed circuit board (PCB). It adhered to the neck comfortably, without restricting vocalization or movement. The device weighed only 760.2 mg and was secured with an adjustable thin strap. The collected vibration signal was transmitted to the MCU via the serial peripheral interface (SPI).
The system also included an acoustic microphone (CUI Devices, CMM-4030D-261) and an MCU (STMicroelectronics, STM32F301C8T6TR) integrated into the main board. The acoustic microphone operated at a 16 kHz sampling rate and 24-bit resolution. The measured reference acoustic signal was transmitted to the MCU through the interchip sound (I2S) interface. The delay between the two collected signals at the MCU was 0.87 ms, and they were synchronized during the post-processing stage. The data was encoded as HEX and transmitted to a connected laptop via RS232 communication, enabling real-time recording.
